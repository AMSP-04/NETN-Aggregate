# NETN-Aggregate
NATO Education and Training Network Aggregate Unit FOM Module

## Introduction

The NETN FAFD representation of aggregate entities such as military units is based on the [SISO-STD-001-2015 standard RPR-FOM v2.0](https://www.sisostds.org/). The NETN FOM Module extends the RPR-FOM with a NETN_Aggregate object class which include additional attributes for unique identification of simulated entities.

It is recommended that NETN federates support the NETN extension for Aggregate Entities. For compatibility reasons, NETN federates, that implement NETN extensions of Aggregate Entities, are also required to support RPR-FOM v2.0.
